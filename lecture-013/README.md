## What is the value of bit

- One bit can contain 2 different values
- Two bit can contain 4 different values
- Three bit can contain 6 different values (Wrong)

## There is a simple formula

- The formula is 2 to the power of n
- 2^1 = 2 bit, 1 bit can contain 2 different values
- 2^2 = 4 bit, 2 bit can contain 4 different values
- 2^3 = 8 bit, 3 bit can contain 8 different values
